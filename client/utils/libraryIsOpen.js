/*
  The Library Hours API (api.lib.sfu.ca/hours/summary) contains an `in_range
  property which is supposed to indicate if the current time is within the
  range of `open_time` and `end_time`. This has proven to not be completely
  reliable (e.g. when the library closes early). This function determines if
  a library location is actually currently open based on the following:
    * if closed_all_day === true => false
    * if open_all_day === true => true
    * if in_range === true:
      * sanity check current time is between `open_time` and `close_time`
*/

    close_time,
  } = location;

  if (closed_all_day) {
    return false;
  }
  if (open_all_day) {
    return true;
  }

  // trust, but verify
  if (in_range) {
    // convert open_time and close_time to date objects
    // if both === "12:00AM", close_time should be 23:59:59
